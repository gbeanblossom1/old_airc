Then, the variations of keyhole shape and laser energy coupling behaviour in the laser-arc hybrid welding process were calculated at three different laser-arc distances. It was found that the laser-arc distance would affected the shape of keyhole generated in the laser-arc hybrid welding process, thus influencing the laser energy coupling efficiency. In the initial stage of each laser pulse, small laser-arc distances favoured the generation of keyholes and multiple reflections of laser beam within keyhole. However, as the laser irradiation time increased, the smaller the laser-arc distance, the more liquid metal were found around the keyholes, which was more favourable to the expansion of keyhole in radial direction. As a result, the aspect ratio of keyhole, the reflection time of laser beams in keyhole, and the laser energy absorbed by keyhole wall decreased.

sending out in this paper-feeding roller 8 and the paper feeding putt|pad 9 and passing along the various rollers 10-12, it is conveyed by the image formation part 5 one each.\u226aA structure of an image formation part\u226bThe image formation part 5 is provided with the scanner part 16, the process cartridge 17, the fixing part 18, etc.\u226aSchematic structure of a scanner part\u226bThe scanner part 16 was provided in the upper part in the main body casing 2, and as shown in FIG. 2, it is provided with the light source device 100, the cylindrical lens 25, the polygon mirror 19, the f(theta) lens 20, and the reflective mirror 22.In order to correct|amend the surface_inclination of the polygon mirror 19, the cylindrical lens 25 restrict|squeezes the laser beam from the light source device 100 to a subscanning direction, and is entered in the polygon mirror 19.The mirror having been formed in the part of each edge of a hexagon, and rotating in itself, it is reflecting the laser beam which passed the cylindrical lens 25, and the polygon mirror 19 deflect|deviates and scans a laser beam to a main scanning direction.The f(theta) lens 20 makes the surface of the photoconductive drum 27 image-form a laser beam, converting the laser beam scanned by the polygon mirror 19 at equal angle speed so that it may scan at uniform velocity.Moreover, as shown in FIG. 1, the scanner part 16 is provided with the correction lens 21 and the reflective mirrors 23 and 24 so that it may orient|assign to the photoconductive drum 27 the laser beam orient|assigned below with the reflective mirror 22.Each of these member is suitably attached to the case 101.The detail of a structure of the light source device 100 is mentioned later.\u226aA structure of a process cartridge\u226bThe process cartridge 17 is arrange|positioned under the scanner part 16, and has a structure with which it mounts|wears detachably with respect to the main body casing 2.And in the hollow housing|casing 51 which comprises the outer frame of this process cartridge 17, the image development cartridge 28, the photoconductive drum 27, the scorotron type|mold electrical charging device 29, and the transfer roller 30 are mainly provided.It mounts|wears with the image development cartridge 28 detachably with respect to the housing|casing 51, and it is provided with the developing roller 31, the layer thickness control blade 32, the feed roller 33, and the toner hopper 34.And the toner currently stored in the toner hopper 34 is supplied to the developing roller 31 by the rotation to the arrow direction (anti-clockwise) of the feed roller 33,At this time, it just tribocharges between the feed roller 33 and the developing roller 31.The toner supplied on the developing roller 31 approachs between the layer thickness control blade 32 and the developing roller 31 with the rotation to the arrow direction (anti-clockwise) of the developing roller 31,It carry|supports on the developing roller 31 as a thin layer of fixed thickness.The photoconductive drum 27 is supported by the housing|casing 51 so that the rotation to an arrow direction (clockwise rotation) is possible.As for this photoconductive drum 27, while a drum main body is earth|grounded, that surface part is formed of the positively-chargeable photosensitive layer.Above the photoconductive drum 27, predetermined space|interval is separated and the scorotron type|mold electrical charging device 29 is opposingly arranged so that the photoconductive drum 27 may not be contacted.This scorotron type|mold electrical charging device 29 is an electrical charging device of the scorotron type|mold for positive charging which generates a corona discharge from wires for electrical charging, such as tungsten,It is comprised so that the surface of the photoconductive drum 27 may be electrically charged positive polarity uniformly.In the downward direction of the photoconductive drum 27, the transfer roller 30 is arrange|positioned so that it may contact facing this photoconductive drum 27, and is supported by the housing|casing 51 so that the rotation to an arrow direction (anti-clockwise) is possible.An electroconductive rubber material is coat|covered by the metal roller axis|shaft, and this transfer roller 30 is comprised.The transcription|transfer bias is applied to this transfer roller 30 by constant current control at the time of transcription|transfer.And after positive charging of the surface of the photoconductive drum 27 is uniformly carried out by the scorotron type|mold electrical charging device 29, it is exposed by the rapid scanning of the laser beam from the scanner part 16.The electric potential of the exposed part falls by this, and the electrostatic latent image based on image data is formed.Here, an\"electrostatic latent image\"means the exposure part into which the laser beam was exposed among the surfaces of the photoconductive drum 27 by which positive charging is carried out uniformly, and the electric potential has fallen.Subsequently, when the toner currently carry|supported on the developing roller 31 contacts facing the photoconductive drum 27 by rotation of the developing roller 31, the electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the photoconductive drum 27 is supplied.And a toner is formed as a visible image by selectively carry|supporting on the surface of the photoconductive drum 27, and a toner image is formed by inversion image development of this.Then, it rotationally drives so that the photoconductive drum 27 and the transfer roller 30 may clamp and convey the paper 3 among both, and the toner image currently carry|supported by the surface of the photoconductive drum 27 is transcribe|transferred on the paper 3 by conveying the paper 3 in between the photoconductive drum 27 and the transfer rollers 30.\u226aA structure of a fixing part\u226bThe fixing part 18 was arrange|positioned by the downstream of the process cartridge 17, and is provided with one pair of conveyance rollers 43 provided in the downstream of the pressure roller 42 which is arrange|positioned facing the heating roller 41 and the heating roller 41, and presses the heating roller 41, these heating roller 41, and the pressure roller 42.And in the fixing part 18 comprised in this way, while the paper 3 passes through between the heating roller 41 and the pressure rollers 42, heat fusing of the toner transcribe|transferred on the paper 3 is carried out,Then, he is trying to convey the paper 3 to the paper ejection path|pass 44 with the conveyance roller 43.In addition, the paper 3 sent to the paper ejection path|pass 44 is paper-ejected on the paper delivery tray 46 with the paper ejection roller 45,Or it is returned by reverse rotation of the paper ejection roller 45, and switch of the flapper 49 in an apparatus,The upstream of the image formation part 5 is re-supplied by inverted condition with several inversion conveyance rollers 50, and double-sided printing is made.\u226aA structure of a light source device\u226bFIG. 3 is a disassembled perspective view of a light source device, and FIG. 4 is an external appearance perspective view of a light source device.Moreover, FIG. 5 is the figure which looked at the lens holder from the entrance plane side,FIG. 6 is sectional drawing (a) of the state which decomposed|disassembled the lens holder and the coupling lens, assembled sectional drawing (b) of a state, and the reference drawing (c) which fixed the coupling lens to the lens holder by the entrance plane side.As shown in FIG. 3, the coupling lens 140 is being fixed to the laser holder 110 which is a holder with the 1st light source device 100 by the lens holder 120 whose semiconductor laser 130 as an example of a light emitting element it fixes and is a 2nd holder.And with respect to the laser holder 110, it adhere|attaches by the photoresist 119 which is an example of an adhesive agent, and the lens holder 120 is fixed, as shown in FIG. 4.As shown in FIG. 3, the coupling lens 140 is a convex lens consisting of resin or glass, converges the laser beam radiate|emitted from the semiconductor laser 130, and is converted into a light beam.The coupling lens 140 has a convex curve in the output surface 141, and the entrance plane 145 is a plane (refer Fig.6 (a)).The plane|planar part 142 perpendicular|vertical to an optical axis is formed in the edge of the output surface 141.This plane|planar part 142 becomes a surface which contact|abuts to the lens holder 120 and positions an optical axis direction with the lens holder 120 so that it may mention later.Both the laser holder 110 and the lens holder 120 are the members formed by carrying out the sheet metal work of the board|plate material which consists of aluminum alloy.Thus, as for the laser holder 110 and the lens holder 120, it is desirable for that the coefficient of thermal expansion is comprised with the equal material to consist of a metal of the same kind desirably.Thereby, even when the surrounding temperature change occurs, adhesion|attachment by the photoresist 119 of the laser holder 110 and the lens holder 120 does not remove|deviate.Moreover, by comprising with a sheet metal, the laser holder 110 and the lens holder 120 are very low-cost, and can be manufactured.Then, the positional relationship of the semiconductor laser 130 and the coupling lens 140 can be positioned with high precision with the fixing method of the lens holder 120 mentioned later, existing.The laser holder 110 comprises the laser holding|maintenance wall 111 in which the semiconductor laser 130 is fixed, the bottom wall 112 ahead extended from the lower end of the laser holding|maintenance wall 111, and the right side wall 113 and the left side wall 114 which were extended upwards from the right-and-left both ends of the bottom wall 112.The through-hole 111a (refer Fig.6 (a)) is formed in the laser holding|maintenance wall 111, and the semiconductor laser 130 is fixed to this through-hole 111a by press_fit|pressure_injection etc.The attachment hole 112a is formed in the bottom wall 112, and it can fix to the above-mentioned case 101 of the scanner part 16 by screwing.The attachment groove|channel 115 where the lens holder 120 is inserted is formed in each upper end of the right side wall 113 and the left side wall 114.The width|variety of the front-back direction of the attachment groove|channel 115 is formed more widely than the plate|board thickness of the lens holder 120.For this reason, within the width|variety of the attachment groove|channel 115, before fixing by the photoresist 119, since the lens holder 120 adjusts that position, it is movable.Moreover, positioning fixing of the lens holder 120 is carried out with respect to the laser holder 110 in the state spaced apart via the photoresist 119.The lens holder 120 has a width|variety (magnitude|size of the left-right direction) corresponding to the distance of the surfaces of the outer side of the right side wall 113 and the left side wall 114.A lower surface extends horizontally in the predetermined range from an edge part, and the right-and-left both ends of the lens holder 120 become the adhesion part 121.The adhesion part 121 is forming in parallel with the bottom face of the attachment groove|channel 115 of the laser holder 110, and it becomes favorable adhere|attaching it according to the photoresist 119.As the lens holder 120 is shown to FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 (a), the recessed part 123 which arrange|positions the coupling lens 140 is formed in the entrance plane side of a laser beam.The recessed part 123 has the attachment surface part 123a formed as a shallow step part near the entrance plane side of a laser beam, and the bottom part 123b, as shown to Fig.6 (a).As shown in FIG.6(b), the attachment surface part 123a contact|abuts with the plane|planar part 142 of the coupling lens 140, and becomes a part which positions the coupling lens 140 in the optical axis direction.The substantially rectangular shaped aperture_diaphragm|restriction (aperture) 122 which restrict|squeezes the width|variety (It is a magnitude|size of the cross section orthogonal to the optical axis of a laser beam, and, especially here, is a width|variety of the up-down direction of FIG. 5.) of a laser beam is formed in the center at the bottom part 123b.That is, the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 122 is integrally formed by the lens holder 120.The longitudinal direction has turned to the left-right direction in FIG. 5.In the case of this embodiment, this longitudinal direction is called cage main scanning direction along the scanning direction of a laser beam.And the direction orthogonal to this main scanning direction, i.e., the up-down direction in FIG. 5, calls it a subscanning direction.As the recessed part 123 is shown in FIG. 5, the outline seen from the entrance plane side is formed somewhat more largely than the outer diameter (it shows with a dashed-two dotted line in FIG. 5) of the coupling lens 140.The outline of the recessed part 123 protrudes inside at three places of the position which followed the outer diameter of the coupling lens 140 and which was not circular and slip|deviated from the right end in FIG. 5, and this right end 120 degree|times,The three lens holding|maintenance convex parts 124 are formed.Moreover, the outline of the recessed part 123 protrudes outside at two places of the upper end in FIG. 5, and a lower end, i.e., a subscanning direction, and forms the adhesive agent holding|maintenance part 125.The lens holding|maintenanceconvex part 124 is arrange|positioned so that 3 points|pieces at the front-end|tip which protruded inside may touch the circle|round|yen of the outer diameter of the coupling lens 140,This positions the coupling lens 140 in a fixed position in the plane|planar position of the lens holder 120.When the adhesive agent holding|maintenance part 125 fixes the coupling lens 140 to the lens holder 120, it is a part which arrange|positions adhesive agents, such as a photoresist.An adhesive agent comes to be easily settled with the surface tension by the adhesive agent holding|maintenance part 125 being formed as a small dent shape.Moreover, since the adhesive agent holding|maintenance part 125 is arrange|positioned among the recessed parts 123 at the subscanning direction, it is far from a laser beam.Therefore, it is hard to interfere in an adhesive agent with a laser beam, and can contribute to arrangement|positioning of such an adhesive agent holding|maintenance part 125 reducing the coupling lens 140 in size.When assembling the light source device 100 of the above structures, the semiconductor laser 130 is first fixed to the laser holder 110 by press_fit|pressure_injection etc.On the other hand, as the plane|planar part 142 of the coupling lens 140 contact|wins the attachment surface part 123a of the lens holder 120, it positions in it, and these are mutually adhere|attached by the photoresist 129.And the photoresist 119 is apply|coated to the attachment groove|channel 115 of the laser holder 110.Next, the lens holder 120 is clamped by the robot hand which is not illustrated,The semiconductor laser 130 is light-emitted,The coupling lens 140 (lens holder 120) is position-adjusted in the attachment groove|channel 115, confirming the focus of the laser beam which passed the coupling lens 140.After position adjustment was complete|finished, while the laser holder 110 has been made to rest still, the photoresist 119 is hardened by irradiating an ultraviolet-ray to the photoresist 119.If the photoresist 119 substantially completely hardens|cures, the assembly of the light source device 100 will be completed.According to such a light source device 100, the coupling lens 140 has the plane|planar part 142 which is a surface which cross|intersects an optical axis at the radiation|emission surface side of a laser beam,It positions the entrance plane side of the lens holder 120 in this plane|planar part 142,ThereforeEven if the difference|error of the thickness of the coupling lens 140 is large, the position of the radiation|emission surface side of the coupling lens 140 with respect to the semiconductor laser 130 is not received by influence.For example, as shown in FIG.6(b), the distance d1 from the light emission part 131 of the semiconductor laser 130 to the position (it shows in the position which protruded most in the output side for convenience) by the side of the output surface 141 of the coupling lens 140 is not received by influence with the thickness of the coupling lens 140.On the other hand, as shown in FIG.6(c), when the entrance plane 145 side of the coupling lens 140 is applied to the lens holder 220 and an optical axis direction is positioned.The distance d2 from the light emission part 131 of the semiconductor laser 130 to the position by the side of the output surface 141 of the coupling lens 140 is received by the influence of the thickness of the coupling lens 140.The convergence of a laser beam with the coupling lens 140,The refraction|bending of influence is larger than the refraction|bending in the surface by the side of the entrance plane 145, and, for the reason, it becomes easy to match|combine the focus of a laser beam by the position by the side of the output surface 141 not being received by the influence of the thickness of a lens like this embodiment.That is, since adjustment amount becomes small when adjusting a position and direction of the lens holder 120 by a robot hand, adjustment time is short and ends.Therefore, productivity of the light source device 100 can be improved.Moreover, when adjustment amount becomes small, even if the dispersion|variation in the thickness of the coupling lens 140 is large, the lens holder 120 can fully be positioned in the correct position in between the attachment groove|channels 115.Therefore, for every thickness of the coupling lens 140, or position of the attachment surface part 123a of the lens holder 120, according to a dimension, these components are grouped in steps and managed,The need of making a favorable combination is lose|eliminated and productivity improves.Furthermore, it restrict|squeezed to the radiation|emission surface side of the coupling lens 140, and 122 has been arrange|positioned,The laser beam which focused|converged on the substantially parallel light beam was restrict|squeezed, and it has restrict|squeezed from this by 122,ThereforeThe width|variety of the light beam which passed the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 122 becomes fixed irrespective of the distance from the semiconductor laser 130 of the lens holder 120.This is demonstrated compared with the conventional example.As shown in FIG.6(c), when it restrict|squeezes to the entrance plane side of the coupling lens 140 and there exists 222, the laser beam which passed the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 222 has still spread,It becomes substantially parallel light only after passing the radiation|emission surface side of the coupling lens 140.Therefore, the width|variety of the light beam after passing the coupling lens 140 differs in this form in which the distance d2 is received by the influence of the thickness of the coupling lens 140 easily according to the difference|error of the thickness of the coupling lens 140, and the position of the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 222.On the other hand, since it restrict|squeezed after becoming parallel light, and the laser beam is restrict|squeezed by 122, the width|variety of a light beam does not differ in this embodiment (FIG.6(b)) mentioned above.Moreover, as shown in FIG.6(b), in the light source device 100 of this embodiment, the coupling lens 140 is arrange|positioned to the entrance plane side of the lens holder 120,At the edge of the incident side of the coupling lens 140, the lens holder 120 is adhere|attached by the photoresist 129.On the other hand, as shown in FIG.6(c), in the light source device 200 of a reference example, the photoresist 229 is arrange|positioned in the radiation|emission surface side of the lens holder 220.Even if the photoresist 129 protrudes to the direction of a laser beam a little, since the laser beam has seldom spread, by the entrance plane side of the coupling lens 140, a laser beam and the overflowing adhesive agent cannot interfere easily at the light source device 100 of this embodiment, so that they may be known seeing these figures.Therefore, the defect of the light source device 100 can be prevented, and it can contribute to size reduction of the coupling lens 140.As mentioned above, according to the light source device 100, the scanner part 16 using the same, and the laser printer 1 of this embodiment, productivity can improve and, as a result, a production cost can be reduced.Next, the modification and reference example which changed a part of light source device concerning the above-mentioned embodiment are shown.(c) is the figure concerning a modification into which the shape of the edge of aperture_diaphragm|restriction was changed from Fig.7 (a).As shown to Fig.7 (a), as for the light source device 300 concerning a 1st modification, the periphery part of the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 322 of the lens holder 320 protrudes in the radiation|emission surface side as a whole,The opposing surface 323 which opposes the coupling lens 140 becomes funnel shape.That is, the edge which contact|wins the at least laser beam of the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 322 inclines with respect to a surface perpendicular|vertical to the optical axis of a laser beam.Therefore, if it goes to the light emission part 131 of the semiconductor laser 130, it does not reflect, but the laser beam which shone upon this opposing surface 323 is reflected toward the position largely shifted.The semiconductor laser 130 is performing feedback control for carrying out an output to regularity normally,Therefore, the sensor of the output is provided in the vicinity of the light emission part 131.Therefore, when the light reflected at the edge of the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 322 returns to the light emission part 131, there exists a possibility that an output may become unstable.However, according to this 1st modification, since the light reflected at the edge where the laser beam of the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 322 contact|wins does not return to the light emission part 131, such a problem is eliminated.The chamfering 423 is formed in the edge of the incident side of the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 422 of the lens holder 420 in the 2nd modification shown in FIG.7(b).Thus, if it forms so that it may incline with respect to the surface orthogonal to the optical axis of a laser beam in the range upon which a laser beam shines even if it is the small chamfering 423, the light reflected with this chamfering 423 will not return to the light emission part 131, but the output of the semiconductor laser 130 will be stabilized.Moreover, inner peripheral itself of the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 522 formed in the lens holder 520 may not be made direction in alignment with the optical axis of the laser beam like the 3rd modification shown in FIG.7(c), but you may form in a taper shape.Also in this case, the light reflected by the inner periphery of the aperture_diaphragm|restriction 522 does not return to the light emission part 131 like a 1st modification and a 2nd modification, but the output of the semiconductor laser 130 is stabilized.FIG. 8 is the figure which looked at the lens holder of the reference example of FIG.6(c) from the radiation|emission surface side.As shown in FIG. 8, when the lens holder 220 is made to contact|abut the surface of the incident side of the coupling lens 140 and it is supported like FIG.6(c), it is possible to acquire the same effect by forming the adhesive agent holding|maintenance part 225 of a structure similar to the adhesive agent holding|maintenance part 125 mentioned above.Namely, the outline of the recessed part 223 in which the coupling lens 140 fitsWHEREIN:By having provided the adhesive agent holding|maintenance part 225 protruded outside in the position of the subscanning direction, a laser beam and the photoresist 229 become difficult to interfere, and the defect of the light source device 200 is prevented,Moreover, size reduction of the coupling lens 140 can be achieved.Moreover, the support site|part which supports the entrance plane of the coupling lens 140 in the lens holder 220 has the two protrusion parts 230 which protrude to a subscanning direction rather than the outer edge of the coupling lens 140, as shown in FIG.6(c) and FIG. 8.And site|parts other than protrusion part 230 of a support site|part are located in the inner side in the radial direction of the coupling lens 140 rather than the outer edge of the coupling lens 140.The protrusion part 230 is the structure which protrudes rather than the outer edge of the coupling lens 140,ThereforeA support site|part supports reliably, without the coupling lens 140 rattling, when positioning the coupling lens 140 to the lens holder 220.Although embodiment of this invention was described above, without being limited to above-mentioned embodiment, it can deform|transform suitably and this invention can be implemented.For example, you may employ|adopt the coupling lens 640 which made both the incident side and the output side the convex curve like the light source device 600 shown in FIG. 9.The robot hand was used for the position of the lens holder 120 (coupling lens 140), and adjustment of direction in above-mentioned embodiment,However,The lens holder 120 is hold|maintained to a goniometer,You may adjust the position of the lens holder 120, and direction manually.Also in this case, the same effect can be acquired because adjustment amount decreases by this invention.In the said embodiment, although the laser printer 1 was illustrated as an example of an image forming apparatus, this invention is not limited to this,You may apply this invention to another image forming apparatus, for example, a copying machine, a multifunctional device, etc.In the said embodiment, although the transfer roller 30 was employ|adopted as an example of a transcription means, this invention is not limited to this,For example, you may employ|adopt a noncontact thing.In the said embodiment, although the papers 3, such as a cardboard, a postcard, and a thin paper, were illustrated as an example of a recording sheet, this invention is not limited to this,For example, an OHP sheet may be sufficient.It was set as an example of the developing agent and the photoconductive drum 27 was employ|adopted as an example of the scanner part 16 and a photoreceptor as an example of the f(theta) lens 20 and exposure apparatus as an example of the polygon mirror

invention is not limited to this.That is, unless it deviates from the meaning of this invention, it cannot be overemphasized that material and a structure can be changed suitably.It is a sectional

plane of a nitride semiconductor layer, and the rear end of a waveguide,The rear-end surface which consists of substantially (0001) plane of a nitride semiconductor layer is provided,The intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from a front-end surface side is made larger than the intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from a rear-end surface side.In the nitride semiconductor laser element by this 1st aspect, it is located in the front end of a waveguide as mentioned above,By providing the front-end surface which consists of substantially (000-1) plane of a nitride semiconductor layer,The substantially (000-1) plane from which outermost layer is different with the substantially (0001) plane which becomes a gallium (Ga) atomic layer easily, and outermost layer turns into a nitrogen (N) atomic layer easily,Since it is hard to be oxidized compared with substantially (0001) plane, it can suppress that the substantially (000-1) plane which is a main laser-beam output surface degrades by oxidation.Thereby, it can suppress that the laser characteristic of a nitride semiconductor laser element becomes unstable.Here, in order to make larger than the intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from a rear-end surface side the intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from a front-end surface side, the reflectance of a front-end surface side is made lower than the reflectance of a rear-end surface side, for example.A dielectric multilayer is formed in at least one of a front-end surface and a rear-end surface in order to make the reflectance of a front-end surface side lower than the reflectance of a rear-end surface side.For example, an anti-reflective film is formed in a front-end surface, or a reflecting film is formed in a rear-end surface.It is still more desirable to form an anti-reflective film in a front-end surface, and to form a reflecting film in a rear-end surface.The nitride semiconductor laser element by the said 1st aspectWHEREIN:The 1st reflecting film which is each provided on the surface of a front-end surface and the surface of a rear-end surface, is further provided with the 1st reflecting film and 2nd reflecting film which consist of dielectric materials, and is preferably provided on the surface of a front-end surface at least does not contain oxygen substantially.Since a

forming the front-end surface which becomes a front end of a waveguide from the substantially (000-1) plane of a nitride semiconductor layer,The substantially (000-1) plane from which outermost layer is different with the substantially (0001) plane which becomes a gallium (Ga) atomic layer easily, and outermost layer turns into a nitrogen (N) atomic layer easily,Since it is hard to be oxidized compared with substantially (0001) plane, it can suppress that the substantially (000-1) plane which is a main laser-beam output surface degrades by oxidation.A nitride semiconductor laser element with possible this suppressing that a laser characteristic becomes unstable can be manufactured.In the manufacturing method of the nitride semiconductor laser element by the said 2nd aspect,The process of preferably providing an unevenness|corrugation in area|regions other than the area|region in which the waveguide of a front-end surface and a rear-end surface is formed is further provided.If comprised in this way, the surface area of a front-end surface and a rear-end surface will increase with an unevenness|corrugation,ThereforeFor example, when hermetic sealing of the nitride semiconductor laser element is carried out to members, such as a package,The degree to which the area|region in which the waveguide of a part|minute for the surface area to have increased, a

surfaces by an etching.If comprised in this way, an unevenness|corrugation can be easily provided in area|regions other than the area|region in which the waveguide of a front-end surface and a

least one of a front-end surface and the rear-end surfaces.Since the atom and molecule|numerator which adsorb|sucked to the front-end surface and the rear-end surface are removable if comprised in this way, it can suppress more that the laser characteristic of a nitride semiconductor laser element becomes unstable.Here, an end surface is cleaned by irradiating a plasma, ozone, etc. to an end surface.Hereinafter, embodiment of this invention is described based on drawing.FIG. 1 is sectional drawing in a surface parallel to the waveguide of a semiconductor laser element for demonstrating the rough structure of the nitride semiconductor laser element of this invention.FIG. 2 is sectional drawing in a surface perpendicular|vertical to the waveguide of a semiconductor laser element for demonstrating the rough structure of a nitride semiconductor laser element shown in FIG. 1.Before describing concrete embodiment of this invention first with reference to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the concept of the nitride semiconductor laser element 100 of this invention is demonstrated.In the nitride semiconductor laser element 100 of this invention, as shown in FIG. 1, the 1st semiconductor layer 2 is formed on the upper surface of the board|substrate 1.In addition, the 1st semiconductor layer 2 is a buffer layer which consists of GaN, for example.Moreover, the 1st cladding layer 3 is formed on the upper surface of the 1st semiconductor layer 2.Moreover, the light emitting layer 4 is formed on the upper surface of the 1st cladding layer 3.In addition, the 1st cladding layer 3 is formed from the nitride-type semiconductor with a larger band gap than the light emitting layer 4.Moreover, you may form the light guide layer which has an intermediate|middle band gap of the 1st cladding layer 3 and the light emitting layer 4 between the 1st cladding layer 3 and the light emitting layer 4.Moreover, the 2nd semiconductor layer 5 is formed on the upper surface of the light emitting layer 4.In addition, the 2nd semiconductor layer 5 is formed from the 2nd cladding layer with a larger band gap than the light emitting layer 4, etc.Moreover, the 2nd semiconductor layer 5 has a conductivity type opposite to the 1st semiconductor layer 2.Moreover, as for the 1st cladding layer 3 and especially the 2nd semiconductor layer 5 (2nd cladding layer), GaN, AlGaN, etc. are used.Moreover, you may form the light guide layer which has an intermediate|middle band cap of the light emitting layer 4 and the 2nd semiconductor layer 5 between the light emitting layer 4 and the 2nd semiconductor layer 5.Moreover, as shown in FIG. 2, the contact layer 6 is formed on the upper surface of the 2nd semiconductor layer 5.As for the contact layer 6, it is desirable for a band gap to be smaller than the 2nd semiconductor layer 5.Moreover, the current block layer 7 which becomes a side surface of the ridge part formed from the 2nd semiconductor layer 5 and the contact layer 6 from dielectric materials, such as SiO2 for confine|sealing an electric current and light in emission region, is formed.Moreover, the ohmic electrode 8 is formed on the upper surface of the contact layer 6.Moreover, the pad electrode 9 is formed on the upper surface of the current block layer 7 and the ohmic electrode 8.Moreover, the n side electrode 10 is formed on the lower surface of the board|substrate 1.Moreover, as for the light emitting layer 4, an undoped case, Si, etc. may be doped and InGaN etc. are used especially as a material of the light emitting layer 4.Moreover, the light emitting layer 4 has a single layer, a single quantum well (SQW), or a multiple quantum well (MQW) structure.Here, the surface orientation of the main surface of the light emitting layer 4 is comprised from (11-20) plane and the abbreviated (H, K, -H-K, 0) surfaces (Here, at least any one which is H and K is a non-zero integer.), such as (1-100) plane.It enables this to reduce the piezo electric field which generate|occur|produces in the light emitting layer 4,ThereforeIt becomes possible to improve the luminous efficiency in the semiconductor laser element part 11 (refer FIG. 2) which consists of the 1st semiconductor layer 2, the 1st cladding layer 3, the light emitting layer 4, the 2nd semiconductor layer 5, and the contact layer 6.Moreover, as shown to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, waveguiding structure is formed in the semiconductor laser element part 11 of the ridge part which consists of the 2nd semiconductor layer 5 and the contact layer 6.Moreover, although not shown in figure, the formation method of waveguiding structure may form waveguiding structure not only by the method of forming a ridge part but by an embedding|flush_mounting heterostructure etc.Moreover, this waveguiding structure is formed in parallel with a substantiallydirection, and has the light-projection surface (front-end surface) 12 which consists of the side end surface of the 1st semiconductor layer 2, the 1st cladding layer 3, the light emitting layer 4, the 2nd semiconductor layer 5, and the contact layer 6 in the front side of a waveguide.Moreover, in the rear surface of a waveguide, it has the light reflective surface (rear-end surface) 13 which consists of the side end surface of the 1st semiconductor layer 2, the 1st cladding layer 3, the light emitting layer 4, the 2nd semiconductor layer 5, and the contact layer 6.Here, in 1st Embodiment, while the light-projection surface 12 consists of substantially (000-1) plane which has for example, polar nitrogen (N) polarity of V group element, the light reflective surface 13 is comprised so that it may consist of substantially (0001) plane which has for example, the polar gallium (Ga) polarity of an III group element.Here, the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 are formed by the etching, a cleavage, and grinding|polishing of dry etching etc.Or it is good also considering the facet formed of selective growth as the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13.Moreover, the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 may be formed by the same method, and you may form by another method.For example, the facet by selective growth may be made into the light-projection surface 12, and the light reflective surface 13 may be formed by an etching.Moreover, in 1st Embodiment, the semiconductor laser element part 11 is comprised so that the intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from the light-projection surface 12 may become larger than the intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from the light reflective surface 13.In addition, as for the main surface of the light emitting layer 4, when forming at least one of the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surfaces 13 by cleavage, it is desirable to set it as the surface orientation of the range of the +/- about 0.3 degree from a surface (H, K, -H-K, 0).Moreover, as for the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 which were formed by the cleavage, it is desirable to respectively set it as the surface orientation of the range of an abbreviation +/-0.3 degree from (000-1) plane and (0001) plane.Moreover, it is possible to form both the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 by methods other than the cleavage of an etching, grinding|polishing, selective growth, etc.Moreover, when forming the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 by an etching, you may form the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 at a separate process.At this time, it is preferable to change the conditions of dry etching in the case of forming the light-projection surface 12 and the conditions of dry etching in the case of forming the light reflective surface 13.Moreover, as shown in FIG. 1, on the surface of the light-projection surface 12, and the surface of the light reflective surface 13, the 1st dielectric film 14 and the 2nd dielectric film 15 which consist of Al2O3, SiO2, etc. are respectively formed.Here, in this invention, the intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from the light-projection surface 12 is comprised so that it may become larger than the intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from the light reflective surface 13.For this objective, the 2nd dielectric film 15 of the light reflective surface 13 is formed so that a reflectance may become high rather than the 1st dielectric film 14 of the light-projection surface 12.Here, this inventor discovered from various experiment that the light-projection surface 12 and the interface of the 1st dielectric film 14, and the light reflective surface 13 and the interface of the 2nd dielectric film 15 would be oxidized if a laser element is driven for a long time.Since, as for the (0001) plane which has Ga polarity, Ga atom becomes uppermost layer easily and, as for the (000-1) plane which has north-pole property with this reverse, N atom becomes uppermost layer easily, (000-1) plane is harder to be oxidized here than (0001) plane.As a result, since it can suppress that the light-projection surface 12 of a laser beam degrades by oxidation by making (000-1) plane into the light-projection surface 12, it becomes possible to acquire the laser characteristic which carried out long term-stable.Moreover, in order to implement|achieve a high-output-laser element, the dielectric film which becomes the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13, for example from oxide films, such as Al2O3 and SiO2, is laminated|stacked,It is common to perform reflectance control.It becomes possible to improve the reflectance which goes to the inside of a laser element by laminating|stacking alternately two layers from which a refractive index differs on the light reflective surface 13.While this becomes possible to raise the intensity|strength of the light in the light-projection surface 12, when optical intensity becomes high, there exists a problem that the oxidation of the light-projection surface 12 is accelerated|stimulated by the photochemical reaction.Since it will become easier to produce this photochemical reaction if the wavelength of a laser beam becomes short, in the case of the nitride semiconductor laser element 100, it poses a serious problem especially.However,By making the light-projection surface 12 where optical intensity is strong into the (000-1) plane which is hard to be oxidized compared with (0001) plane in this invention,For example, even when it is made to drive for a long period of time at the time of high-output operation|movement of 100 mW or more, it becomes possible to implement|achieve the nitride semiconductor laser element 100 where operation|movement was stabilized.Moreover, for example, the layer which contact|connects a semiconductor does not contain oxygen, it becomes possible by setting it as nitride films, such as AlN, and fluorination films|membranes, such as CaF, to suppress the oxidation in the interface of a semiconductor and the film|membrane laminated|stacked on a semiconductor.For example at the time of the high-output operation|movement of 100 mW, this becomes possible to implement|achieve the nitride semiconductor laser element 100 where operation|movement was stabilized more.Moreover, although a single layer or a multilayer may be sufficient as the 1st dielectric film 14 formed on the surface of the light-projection surface 12, it becomes like this.Preferably, three layers are good.This becomes easily possible to suppress the oxidation of the light-projection surface 12.Since a reflectance will become high on the other hand if the total of the 1st dielectric film 14 formed on the surface of the light-projection surface 12 is increased too much, there exists a problem that high-output operation|movement becomes difficult.Moreover, since control of a reflectance and ensuring of reproducibility become difficult, there exists a problem of causing the fall of the yield of the nitride semiconductor laser element 100.Moreover, it is preferable to form the 2nd dielectric film 15 formed on the surface of the light reflective surface 13 with a multilayer film so that a reflectance may become high.However, when the total of the 2nd dielectric film 15 formed on the surface of the light reflective surface 13 is increased too much, there exists a problem that control of a reflectance and ensuring of reproducibility become difficult, similarly to the light-projection surface 12.Moreover, since distortion by the reflecting film which consists of a semiconductor and the 2nd dielectric film 15 increases, there exists a tendency which malfunctions, such as film|membrane peeling of the 2nd dielectric film 15, produce.Therefore, as for the 2nd dielectric film 15 formed on the surface of the light reflective surface 13, five to 17 layers are the most preferable.Moreover, by plasma-processing the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 within a vacuum device prior to the process for which the 1st dielectric film 14 and the 2nd dielectric film 15 are each formed in the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13,After cleaning the surface, it is preferable to each form said 1st dielectric film 14 and 2nd dielectric film 15.It becomes possible to remove the natural oxide film formed in the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 by this after forming the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 before the 1st dielectric film 14 and the 2nd dielectric film 15 are formed.Moreover, it is most preferable that the gas used for the said plasma processing is nitrogen.It enables N atom to make more nitrogen rich especially the light-projection surface 12 which is the (000-1) plane which becomes uppermost layer easily by this,ThereforeEven when operating the nitride semiconductor laser element 100 for a long time, it becomes possible about the light-projection surface 12 oxidizing to suppress more.Moreover, the board|substrate for the growth may be sufficient as the board|substrate 1, and a support substrate may be sufficient as it.When the board|substrate 1 is a board|substrate for the growth, the board|substrate 1 is comprised by the different kind|species board|substrate which is neither a nitride-type semiconductor substrate nor a nitride-type semiconductor.As a different kind|species board|substrate which is not a nitride system, the (alpha)- SiC substrate of a hexagonal crystal structure and a rhombohedron structure, a ZnO board|substrate, a sapphire substrate, a spinel board|substrate, and a LiAlO3 board|substrate etc. are used, for example.On the other hand, in order to obtain a crystalline good nitride semiconductor layer (semiconductor laser element part 11) most, it is preferable to use a nitride-type semiconductor substrate.Moreover, the light emitting layer 4 which makes a main surface the same surface orientation as the surface orientation of the board|substrate for the growth can be formed on the board|substrate for the growth (board|substrate 1) by using the board|substrate of the surface orientation of abbreviated (H, K, -H-K, 0) surfaces, such as when using a nitride-type semiconductor substrate, the (alpha)- SiC substrate, and a ZnO board|substrate, they are (11-20) plane and (1-100) plane, as the board|substrate 1.In addition, as for the board|substrate for the growth, when forming at least one of the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surfaces 13 by cleavage, it is desirable to set it as the surface orientation of the range of the +/- about 0.3 degree from a surface (H, K, -H-K, 0).Moreover, as for the board|substrate for the growth, when forming both the light-projection surface 12 and the light reflective surface 13 by methods other than the cleavage of an etching, grinding|polishing, selective growth, etc., it is desirable to set it as the surface orientation of the range of the +/- about 25 degree from a surface (H, K, -H-K, 0).Moreover, when using a sapphire substrate as the board|substrate 1, it becomes possible by using the board|substrate of the surface orientation of (1-102) plane to form the light emitting layer 4 which makes (1-100) plane a main surface on the board|substrate for the growth.Moreover, when a (gamma)- LiAlO3 board|substrate is used as the board|substrate 1,(100) By using the board|substrate of the surface orientation of a surface, the light emitting layer 4 which makes (1-100) plane a main surface can be formed on the board|substrate for the growth.Moreover, when using the board|substrate for the growth which has electroconductivity, you may form an electrode layer (not shown) in the surface of the board|substrate for the growth on the opposite side to the side which joins a semiconductor layer (semiconductor laser element part 11).Moreover, when the board|substrate for the growth is a semiconductor, the 1st semiconductor layer 2 may have the same conductivity type as the conductivity type of the board|substrate for the growth.Moreover, when the board|substrate 1 is a support substrate, a support substrate (board|substrate 1) and the semiconductor laser element part 11 are joined via solder etc.Moreover, a support substrate (board|substrate 1) may have electroconductivity and may have insulation.Moreover, as an example of the support substrate (board|substrate 1) which has electroconductivity,Metal plates, such as Cu-W, Al, Fe-Ni,Semiconductor substrates, such as Si of a single crystal, SiC, GaAs, and ZnO,You may use the AlN board|substrate of a polycrystal, etc.Moreover, you may use the composite material etc. of the conductive resin film, and metal and the metal oxide to which electroconductive metal microparticles|fine-particles were disperse|distributed.Moreover, you may use the carbon and the metal matrix composite comprised with the graphite particle sintered compact which impregnated the metal.Moreover, in the case of the support substrate (board|substrate 1) which has electroconductivity, you may form an electrode layer (not shown) in the surface of the support substrate on the opposite side to the side which joins a semiconductor layer (semiconductor laser element part 11).Hereinafter, embodiment of this invention which actualized the

laser element 101 is comprised so that the intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from the light-projection surface 41 may become larger than the intensity|strength of the laser beam radiate|emitted from the light reflective surface 42.In addition, the light-projection surface 41 and the light reflective surface 42 are respectively examples of the\"front-end surface\"of this invention, and a\"rear-end surface.\"Moreover, as shown in FIG. 3, on the surface of the light-projection surface 41 of a laser beam,The dielectric multilayer 45 of about 5% of the reflectance formed in order of the AlN film|membrane 43 which has the AlN film|membrane 43 which has thickness of about 10 nm, the Al2O3 film|membrane 44 which has thickness of about 85 nm, and thickness of about 10 nm in an order from the semiconductor layer side is formed.In addition, the AlN film|membrane 43 is an example of the\"1st reflecting film\"of this invention.Moreover, on the surface of the light

AlN film|membrane 46 is an example of the\"2nd reflecting film\"of this invention.Next, with reference to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the manufacturing process of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 101 by 1st Embodiment is demonstrated.First, the organometallic gaseous-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) method is used on the upper surface of n-type GaN substrate 31,The n side layer 32 (thickness: about 100 nm), the n-type cladding layer 33 (thickness: about 400 nm), light emitting layer 34 (The n-type carrier block layer which has thickness of about 5 nm, the n-type light guide layer which has thickness of about 100 nm, the MQW active layer which has thickness of a total of about 90 nm, the p-type light guide layer which has thickness of about 100 nm, the p-type carrier block layer which has thickness of about 20 nm), the p-type cladding layer 35 (thickness in the convex part 35a: about 400 nm), and the p-type contact layer 36 (thickness: about 10 nm) are formed sequentially.Then, after performing p-type-ized annealing treatment and formation of a ridge part, the p side ohmic electrode 37 (thickness: about 255 nm), the current block layer 38 (thickness: about 250 nm), and the p side pad electrode 39 (thickness: about 3.2 micrometers) are formed.Moreover, on the lower surface of n-type GaN substrate 31, the organometallic gaseous-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) method is used, and the n side electrode 40 (thickness: about 330 nm) is formed.Here, in 1st Embodiment, n-type GaN substrate 31 in which the semiconductor laser structure was formed is cleaved so that the cleavage plane of (0001) plane may be formed, and the structure isolate|separated into bar-shape is formed.Then, the board|substrate with which the cleavage plane was formed is introduced into an electron-cyclotron-resonance (ECR) sputter film deposition apparatus.Moreover, in 1st Embodiment, the light-projection surface 41 is cleaned by irradiating an ECR plasma to the light-projection surface 41 which consists of a cleavage plane of (000-1) plane for about 5 minutes.An ECR plasma is generated on the conditions of about 500 W of microwave outputs in about 0.02-Pa N2 gas atmosphere.At this time, the light-projection surface 41 is etched light.In addition, RF power is not applied to a sputter|spatter target in that case.Such a process enables it to make nitrogen rich the semiconductor layer of the light-projection surface 41,ThereforeWhen driving the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 101 for a long period of time, it is thought that it becomes possible to suppress that the light-projection surface 41 oxidizes.Then, the dielectric multilayer 45 (refer FIG. 3) is formed in the light-projection surface 41 by an ECR sputtering method.Moreover, in 1st Embodiment, the light reflective surface 42 which consists of a cleavage plane of (0001) plane is cleaned by irradiating an ECR plasma to the light reflective surface 42 which consists of a cleavage plane of (0001) plane for about 5 minutes similarly to the process at the time of cleaning the light-projection surface 41.In addition, RF power is not applied to a sputter|spatter target in that case.The light reflective surface 42 is etched light by these processes.Then, the dielectric multilayer 48 is formed in the light reflective surface 42 by an ECR sputtering method.Thus, the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 101 by 1st Embodiment is formed.In 1st Embodiment, it is located in the front end of a waveguide as mentioned above,By providing the light-projection surface 41 which consists of substantially (000-1) plane, outermost layer is different with the substantially (0001) plane which becomes a gallium (Ga) atomic layer easily,Since the substantially (000-1) plane from which outermost layer turns into a nitrogen (N) atomic layer easily is hard to be oxidized compared with substantially (0001) plane, it can suppress that the substantially (000-1) plane which is a main laser-beam output surface degrades by oxidation.Thereby, it can suppress that the laser characteristic of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 101 becomes unstable.Moreover, by each being provided on the surface of the light-projection surface 41, and the surface of the light reflective surface 42, and providing the AlN film|membrane 43 and the AlN film|membrane 46 consisting of a dielectric material as mentioned above, in 1st Embodiment,Since the AlN film|membrane 43 and the AlN film|membrane 46 do not contain oxygen substantially, they can suppress that the light-projection surface 41 and the light reflective surface 42 which each contact|connect the AlN film|membrane 43 and the AlN film|membrane 46 are oxidized.Moreover, in 1st Embodiment, the natural oxide film formed in the light-projection surface 41 and the light reflective surface 42 is removable by cleaning by providing the process of cleaning, as mentioned above with respect to the light-projection surface 41 and the light reflective surface 42,ThereforeIt can suppress more that the laser characteristic of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 101 becomes unstable.(Modification of 1st Embodiment)Next, the modification of 1st Embodiment is demonstrated.In the modification of 1st Embodiment, Al which comprises the n-type cladding layer 33, the light emitting layer 34, and the p-type cladding layer 35, such as AlGaN and InGaN, differs from In composition.Specifically in the said 1st Embodiment, Al0.07Ga0.93N was used as the n-type cladding layer 33 and the p-type cladding layer 35,However,In the modification of 1st Embodiment, Al0.03Ga0.97N is used as the n-type cladding layer 33 and the p-type cladding layer 35.In addition, the amount of doping and carrier concentration of the n-type cladding layer 33 in the modification of 1st Embodiment and the p-type cladding layer 35 are the same as that of the said 1st Embodiment.Moreover, the light emitting layer 34 of the modification of 1st Embodiment is different with the said 1st Embodiment, and the n-type carrier block layer which consists of Al0.10Ga0.90N of a n-type, and the n-type light guide layer which consists of a n-type In0.05Ga0.95N are used.In addition, the thickness of the n-type carrier block layer in the modification of 1st Embodiment and a n-type light guide layer, the amount of doping, and carrier concentration are the same as that of the said 1st Embodiment.Furthermore, in the modification of 1st Embodiment, the MQW active layer of the light emitting layer 34 is different with the said 1st Embodiment, and has a structure where the barrier layer of three layers which consists of undoped In0.25Ga0.75N, and the two-layer well layer which consists of In0.55Ga0.45N were laminated|stacked alternately.In addition, each thickness of the barrier layer in the modification of 1st Embodiment and a well layer is the same as that of the said 1st Embodiment.In addition, the light emitting layer 34 of the modification of 1st Embodiment is different with the said 1st Embodiment, and the p-type carrier block layer which consists of Al0.10Ga0.90N of a p-type, and the p-type light guide layer which consists of a p-type In0.05Ga0.95N are used.In addition, the thickness of the p-type carrier block layer in the modification of 1st Embodiment and a p-type light guide layer, the amount of doping, and carrier concentration are the same as that of the said 1st Embodiment.Moreover, the other structure of the modification of 1st Embodiment is the same as that of the said 1st Embodiment.In the modification of 1st Embodiment, an active layer becomes easy to be oxidized according to In composition included in a MQW active layer being high compared with the said 1st Embodiment,ThereforeCompared with the said 1st Embodiment, the effect of this invention becomes more remarkable.In particular, in the modification of 1st Embodiment, an active layer becomes easy to be oxidized by being the structure (In composition of InGaN which comprises a well layer exceeds 0.5.) with more In compositions included in the well layer of a MQW active layer than Ga composition,ThereforeCompared with the said 1st Embodiment, the effect of this invention becomes more remarkable.(2nd Embodiment)With reference to FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, in this 2nd Embodiment, it is different with the said 1st Embodiment, and demonstrates the case where the semiconductor laser structure is formed on the n-type GaN (1-100) plane off substrate 51.As shown to FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, while having thickness of about 100 micrometers,On the n-type GaN (1-100) plane off substrate 51 by which the oxygen which has the carrier concentration of abbreviation 5*1018cm-3 was doped, the semiconductor laser structure of the same structure as 1st Embodiment is formed.In addition, the other structure of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 102 by 2nd Embodiment is the same as that of the said 1st Embodiment.(Modification of 2nd Embodiment)Next, the modification of 2nd Embodiment is demonstrated.In the modification of 2nd Embodiment, the structure similar to the modification of the said 1st Embodiment is applied to the said 2nd Embodiment,As shown to FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, while having thickness of about 100 micrometers,On the n-type GaN (1-100) plane off substrate 51 by which the oxygen which has the carrier concentration of abbreviation 5*1018cm-3 was doped, the semiconductor laser structure of the same structure as the modification of the said 1st Embodiment is formed.In addition, the other structure of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element by the modification of 2nd Embodiment is the same as the modification of the said 1st Embodiment.In the modification of 2nd Embodiment, an active layer becomes easy to be oxidized according to In composition included in a MQW active layer being high compared with the said 2nd Embodiment,ThereforeCompared with the said 2nd Embodiment, the effect of this invention becomes more remarkable.In particular, in the modification of 2nd Embodiment, an active layer becomes easy to be oxidized by being the structure (In composition of InGaN which comprises a well layer exceeds 0.5.) with more In compositions included in the well layer of a MQW active layer than Ga composition,ThereforeCompared with the said 2nd Embodiment, the effect of this invention becomes more remarkable.(3rd Embodiment)FIG. 7 is sectional drawing for demonstrating the structure of the nitride semiconductor laser element by 3rd Embodiment of this invention.FIG. 7 is referred,In this 3rd Embodiment, it is different with the said 1st Embodiment, and demonstrates the structure of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 by which the unevenness|corrugation 62 is provided in area|regions other than the area|region in which the waveguide of the light-projection surface 41 and the light reflective surface 42 is formed.As shown in FIG. 7, the groove part 61 which has depth D for forming the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 by cleavage is formed in the edge part of the p-type cladding layer 35 of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103, and the current block layer 38.Moreover, the irregular unevenness|corrugation 62 is formed in area|regions other than the area|region in which the waveguide of the light-projection surface 63 (refer FIG. 3) and the light reflective surface 64 (refer FIG. 3) is formed.In addition, the other structure of 3rd Embodiment is the same as that of the said 1st Embodiment.FIG. 8 is a top view for demonstrating the process of producing the nitride semiconductor laser element shown in FIG. 7 by cleavage.Next, with reference to FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, the process of producing the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 by 3rd Embodiment by cleavage is demonstrated.In FIG. 8, the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 for six elements formed on one wafer of the manufacturing process similar to the said 1st Embodiment is shown.As shown in FIG. 8, from the upper surface side (upper surface side of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103) of a wafer,The groove part 61 which has depth D (refer FIG. 7) and length L (about 1 micrometer - about 10 micrometers) 1 (about 1 micrometer - about 100 micrometers), and the width W (about 20 micrometers - about 150 micrometers) 1 is formed by the laser scribing method with the period similar to the element size of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103.Here, the conditions of the laser scribing set the laser power to about 200 mW - about 250 mW, and made scanning speed about 2 mm/sec. - about 10 mm/sec. while they were about 355 nm in laser wavelength.Moreover, the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 is formed so that it may have about 400 micrometers length L 2, while having about 200 micrometers width W 2.In addition, length L 2 of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 can be enlarged as it enlarges width W 2.However, as for the width W 2 of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103, when the maximum value of the width|variety of a scribe is made into Wmax, it is desirable to set it as 50\u226a=W2-Wmax\u226a=150.Moreover, it is preferable to make the shape of the groove part 61 into V shape with respect to a depth D (refer FIG. 7) direction, so that the area of the bottom part of the groove part 61 may become small.By using such a shape, it can recover|yield and can cleave well.Next, after forming the several groove part 61, as shown in FIG. 8, it becomes possible by cleaving along a broken line parallel to substantially direction to form the cleavage plane which consists of substantially (000-1) plane and substantially (0001) plane.Under the present circumstances, the unevenness|corrugation 62 (refer FIG. 7) is formed in area|regions other than the area|region in which the waveguide of the light-projection surface 63 and the light reflective surface 64 is formed.FIG. 9 is sectional drawing which showed the structure of the nitride-type semiconductor laser apparatus by 3rd Embodiment of this invention.Next, the structure of the nitride-type semiconductor laser apparatus 200 is demonstrated using FIG. 9.As a structure of the nitride-type semiconductor laser apparatus 200 of 3rd Embodiment, as shown in FIG. 9, the heat radiating member 201a is integrally formed in the iron stems 201.And the heat sink (sub-mount) 202 is attached to the heat radiating member 201a, and the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 is attached to the heat sink 202.This GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 is arrange|positioned so that the dielectric multilayer 66 by the side of the light reflective surface 64 may oppose the stem 201, while opposing the cap glass 205 which the dielectric multilayer 65 by the side of the light-projection surface 63 mentions later.Moreover, the read|lead 203a and 203b of two is attached to the stem 201.Moreover, the read|lead 203a and 203b is the states in which airtightness was hold|maintained, and is attached to the stem 201.Moreover, the cap part 204 is joined to the stem 201.The cap glass 205 is melt|fused by the area|region corresponding to the opening part 204a of this cap part 204.Moreover, hermetic sealing of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 is carried out by the cap part 204 in a desired gas atmosphere.Here, when performing high-output operation|movement of 100 mW or more, it is desirable for water concentration in the gas of hermetic sealing to be 5000 ppm or less.This becomes possible at the time of high-output operation|movement to suppress that the end surface of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 is oxidized by activating the water|moisture content of cap part 204 inside optically and thermally.In 3rd Embodiment, the surface area of the light-projection surface 63 and the light reflective surface 64 increases with the unevenness|corrugation 62 by providing the unevenness|corrugation 62 in area|regions other than the area|region in which the waveguide of the light-projection surface 63 and the light reflective surface 64 is formed as mentioned above,ThereforeWhen hermetic sealing of the GaN-type semiconductor laser element 103 is carried out to the cap part 204,The degree to which the area|region in which the waveguide of a part|minute for the surface area to have increased, the light-projection surface 63, and the light reflective surface 64 is formed of the oxygen amount which exists in the cap part 204 being limited is oxidized can be made small.Thereby, for example at the time of high-output operation|movement of 100 mW or more, long term-stable can be carried out, and it can be operated.In addition, the other effect of 3rd Embodiment is the same as that of the said 1st Embodiment.(Modification of 3rd Embodiment)Next, the modification of 3rd Embodiment is demonstrated.In the modification of 3rd Embodiment, the structure similar to the modification of the said 1st Embodiment is applied to the said 3rd Embodiment,As shown in FIG. 7, it is the GaN-type semiconductor laser element by which the unevenness|corrugation 62 is provided in area|regions other than the area|region in which it is different with the modification of the said 1st Embodiment, and the waveguide of the

In this project, ultra-intense lasers will be used to create, control and study plasmas. Pulses of laser light from modern lasers can be made so focused as to allow the laser fields to push on electrons like a snowplow. In this project, the laser pulses are shaped so that they travel with a tilt, much as a tilted snowplow blade scoops up the snow and pushes it to the side. With careful laser control, the electrons can be separated from the ions and be formed by such a tilted snowplow into a beam. If the range of electron beam angles and energies can be made as small as the calculations predict, and the beam energy as high as the calculations predict, the electron beam can be used to study materials, or be boosted to even higher energies with additional particle acceleration techniques. The project will support and train one PhD student and two undergraduate students at the Colorado School of Mines. | This project exploits the structuring of the spatial and temporal shape of intense, ultrafast laser pulses to control electron dynamics in plasmas. One type of structuring that will be used is where the spectral components of the laser pulse are overlapped at the focus with an incident angle that is linearly dependent on the frequency. This results in a pulse that sweeps across the focal plane with a speed that can be much lower than the speed of light. This reduced speed allows the light pressure on the electrons to capture and accelerate them to the side. With careful shaping of the transverse intensity profile, theory predicts electrons can be accelerated with a narrow energy and angular spread, making them useful for ultrafast electron diffraction and injection into other laser-based electron accelerators. In this project, the physics of this acceleration mechanism will be experimentally and computationally explored. At higher density, the fast current pulse created by this mechanism is predicted to produce terahertz radiation that will be characterized with novel single pixel imaging techniques. Another method of structuring the laser light involves converting the polarization state of the laser beam to transverse electric. When this azimuthally polarized beam is focused tightly, the magnetic field develops a longitudinal component on axis that can be over 10 kTesla, orders of magnitude higher than the strongest magnets.
